This program is a personal calorie tracker that is designed to take in specific
user input and display a status report at the end that summarizes their daily
calorie intake.

In order to run this program you will need an IDE that supports Kotlin development.
I recommend using 'IntelliJ IDEA'. (A link to its download page can be found below:

    https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

Once the IDE is set up, clone this repository into a local destination and run 'Main.kt'.
You will be prompted with several questions. Once all are answered, a status report will
be displayed.
